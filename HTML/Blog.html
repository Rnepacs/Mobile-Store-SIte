			<!--1st heading and paragraph section-->
			<h3 style="margin: 15px 15px; font-family: sans-serif;">Introduction</h3>
			<p>Humankind has always been destined to create new invetions and projections to make their life better due to our superiority in advanced cognitive skills,social intelligence,planning and reasoining; which is what basically differs us from animals. Whether it be the first tools 3.3 millions years ago that were used to help for hunting, or it is the latest technology mobile phones which can do many kind of wonders, advancement in technology has always been the main cause of human life betterment. If we are to look at our present day situations, we rely on technologies such as mobile phones, computers, electronic appliances etc. for our everyday use and to help us conduct our life functions in much faster and easier way possible. </p>

			<!--2nd heading and paragraph section-->
			<h3 style="margin: 15px 15px; font-family: sans-serif;">Dependency</h3>
			<p>We use our phones to call and contact people, to add reminders to the list so we don't forget our task, add important notes, save our photos, and use different entertainment features to comfort ourselves. In short, if we are to define it in a unique way, we have become "Cyborgs." We are living organisms but we rely on an external technological device, which to attached to us 24-7, to conduct our everyday work with ease. We have extended the dependency to such extends that the first thing after we wake up and the last thing we use before we sleep are our phones or electronic gadgets. We look or use our phone for more than 8hrs a day in average which is more than 34% of our daily time. If we are to add our average sleep time to that context, we will only have 32% of our days to do something productive, even in which we have to comply with our basic needs. Technological dependencies are not just limited to mobile phones, we use laptops, fridger, vaccum, etc. that helps to do our everyday work swiftly and with ease. Some of the parts of the technological advancements have been good, while some of them are turning out to be major problem for us as humanbeings.</p>

			<!--3rd heading and paragraph section-->
			<h3 style="margin: 15px 15px; font-family: sans-serif;">Health and Social Issues</h3>
			<p>Use of technology in our daily lives have brought some issues along with its advancements. Majority of population, especially children tend to spend their time alone on their gadgets, rather than communicate with their friends and family.
			This causes issue in their social upbringing and they loose the essence of being a social animals, which neurologically and societally has helped us to survive and thrive, together. This extensive use of gadgets and mobile phones also have some health issues. Constant gazing on these devices without any particular rest to their eyes causes several eyesight issues and the longheld postures that they use to look at their phone and computers causes different spinal issues and bad posture syndrome, which will only have negative and painful effects on their lives in the future.</p>

			<!--4th heading and paragraph section-->
			<h3 style="margin: 15px 15px; font-family: sans-serif;">Benefits</h3>
			<p>Keeping aside the growing side effects, there are alot of benefits technologies have brought to our daily life. We are able to conduct activities that required large number of manpower and time in just a click or a swipe. Technology is the reason why our lives are so convinient and this century is the best in term of comfort and facilities that we have just because of the surge in technological advancement. We are able to communicate realtime, send large and important informations in the form of waves and signals in just few minutes, wash clothes with press of few buttons, everything that took lot of effort, energy, and work can just be done simply. Technology is advancing rapidly and will be surpassing itself everyyear in coming years. What we had 5 years ago is already a thing of low capability and capacity. We are in a generation of technological advancement and it will keep advancing, benefiting our daily life and easing our activities. </p>

			<!--5th heading and paragraph section-->
			<h3 style="margin: 15px 15px; font-family: sans-serif;">Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Technological advancement has been a blessing to the humankind but it also has its negative side. It has helped us live a better life while hindering the life we have, at the same time. It is useful for what we are doing and where we are going but it is dangerous to its extent too. What we can do as one of the kind that invented those technologies, is to work with it will proper awareness and intelligence to the extent where it is extremely useful to us and not harmful just because we are over indulged in it. Technology was supposed to be there for the betterment and we should keep it that way. As we are advancing in this 21st century, the technologies in the future will be way beyond our imaginations but we should be caredul and use it will full idea for our benefit and prosperity. It can be our best tool and guide if we use it properly; it can be our worst enemy and cause for many ailments and difficulties, if not used properly. What we have to do as the most intelligent animal of this planet is to choose wisely.</p>
